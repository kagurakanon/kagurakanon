Hi, this is Kagura Kanon!

- 🏫 I'm an astronomy student at the University of Tokyo. I also work remotely
  at the MoS Observatory Inc., as an embedded engineer.
- 🔭 My research interests are astronomy, quantum mechanics and condensed matter
  physics. I'm recently relearning astrophysics.
- 🧩 I'm familiar with Forth, Standard ML and some other popular languages.
- 🍶 I like chilled rice wine, including makguli, amazake, and sake. Sponsor me
  if you want to buy me a drink.
